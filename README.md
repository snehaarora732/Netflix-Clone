Netflix Clone ðŸŽ¬
This is a Netflix Clone project, built using HTML and CSS to replicate the sleek and modern UI of Netflix. The goal of this project is to improve my frontend development skills by focusing on layout design, responsiveness, and styling without using any frameworks (yet!).

âœ¨ Features (So Far)
Pixel-Perfect UI: Designed to closely match Netflixâ€™s homepage, including the header, hero section, and movie grid layout.
Responsive Design: Ensured adaptability across different screen sizes using CSS flexbox and grid.
Custom Styling: Carefully crafted hover effects, buttons, and text overlays to resemble Netflixâ€™s aesthetic.
ðŸš€ Future Enhancements
This project is just getting started! In the next updates, I plan to add:

JavaScript to make the UI interactive (like a working carousel and dynamic movie sections).
React.js to structure components efficiently.
Bootstrap to streamline responsiveness and improve UI elements.
Iâ€™m excited to keep refining this project and making it more functional. Stay tuned for updates, and feel free to share your feedback or contribute! ðŸ˜ƒ
